## Divisibility

### Divisibility Rules

1. **Divisibility by 1**: Every integer is divisible by 1.

2. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).

3. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

4. **Divisibility by 4**: A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4.

5. **Divisibility by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5.

6. **Divisibility by 6**: A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

7. **Divisibility by 7**: To check if a number is divisible by 7, double the last digit, subtract it from the rest of the number, and see if the result is divisible by 7.
   - **Example**: For 203, double the last digit (3 Ã— 2 = 6), subtract from the rest (20 - 6 = 14). Since 14 is divisible by 7, 203 is also divisible by 7.

8. **Divisibility by 8**: A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8.

9. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

10. **Divisibility by 10**: A number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0.

11. **Divisibility by 11**: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is divisible by 11.
	   - **Example**: For 121, the sum of digits in odd positions is 1 + 1 = 2, and the sum in even positions is 2. The difference is 2 - 2 = 0, which is divisible by 11, so 121 is divisible by 11.
