// Walk - A random traversal of graph Eg: (A to B to C to A to C) 
// Trail - A walk in which edges cannot be repeated but Vertices can be
// Euler Circuit - A trail in which the start and the end is the same vertice and covers all the edges
// Eulerican Path - Path that visits every edge in a graph exactly once. The starting and ending points of an Eulerian path are different vertices. 

// 1. Undirected Graph
// Eulerian Circuit (Cycle):

// Every vertex has an even degree.
// Eulerian Path:

// Either all vertices have even degree (which means it is an Eulerian circuit) OR
// Exactly two vertices have odd degree.

// 2. Directed Graph
// Eulerian Circuit (Cycle):

// Every vertex has equal in-degree and out-degree.
// Eulerian Path:

// At most one vertex has (out-degree) - (in-degree) = 1.
// At most one vertex has (in-degree) - (out-degree) = 1.
// All other vertices have equal in-degree and out-degree.
